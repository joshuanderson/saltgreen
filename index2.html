	    						Steve has many years of experience in the construction industry and has in 
	    						that time tackled an array of challenging building problems. Whilst Steve's 
	    						specialism is carpentry and joinery he has a wide knowledge of all aspects 
	    						of building and maintenance work and works collaboratively with skilled trade 
	    						professionals to deliver a thorough and reputable service.
