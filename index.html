					<p>
						&ldquo; Steve, Thank you so much for the lovely book case and shelving that you designed and
						fitted for us. What started out as a grotty alcove with some ill fitting shelves has turned
						into a really nice piece of furniture and has at last given us somewhere to put our ever
						increasing selection of books; we couldn't be more pleased. You're a star. &rdquo;<br><br>
						&mdash; Julie, Rodbourne Green

						&ldquo; Mr Anderson's carpentry skills are excellent, he provides a friendly, helpful service
						and can make the difference to your home that you may not have even thought was
						possible. &rdquo;<br><br>
						&mdash; Mary, Swindon

						&ldquo; Hi Steve, Just wanted to send you a quick email to say a big thank for all your work
						on our new house. The new doors and fitted wardrobe are excellent and I will have no qualms
						recommending you to my friends and family. Once again thanks. &rdquo;<br><br>
						&mdash; Paula, Nythe

						&ldquo; As a Tradesman, Steve is conscientious and thoughtful, and will check with me if he
						feels something might be changed / altered for the better. Not only was his work good, but he
						clears up behind himself - a really good 'find'. I have been able to employ Steve for a number
						of routine jobs, but one of the best pieces of work he has done so far, was a completely
						bespoke set of cupboards, floor and wall, designed to fit into an awkward alcove. Once
						completed, they looked so much part of the room, it was difficult to imagine the place without
						them. Steve has proved to be very trustworthy, which is important, as I live on my
						own. &rdquo;<br><br>
						&mdash; Ms Mitchell, Nythe
